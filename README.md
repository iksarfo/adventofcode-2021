### Day #1 ###
Googling every other thing for syntax

>Obvious room for improvement:
> * Start using functions eh?
> * How about some tests brah
> * Integrate auth and read input from site
> * Some well dodgy error-handling

### Day #2 ###
A little more natural

> * Preferring the Python to Go
>   * Without concurrency why wouldn't you?
> * Pretty sure neither is idiomatic here
> * There must be a better way of running Go than dropping to commandline

### Day #3 ###
Really missing my ternary operator & LINQ

> * Completing solutions first in Go
> * Is there really no map, filter & reduce?
>   * Could I substitute channels for pipelines, passing in func arguments? :)
